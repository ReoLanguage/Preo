# Preo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joseproenca/preo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joseproenca/preo)

Parameterised Reo - a concrete language for a calculus of variable connectors.



# History

This is a simplified version, with less features, based on https://github.com/joseproenca/parameterised-connectors.

<!-- This version is used by the new under-development web-related project, which can be found in https://github.com/joseproenca/reotools. -->

## Why a new project?
The emphasise is in the core language, which we call Preo, it's parser, and its static analysis.
We drop references to how to execute code and how to display it in a browser, and give less relevance to the Scala embedded DSL.
