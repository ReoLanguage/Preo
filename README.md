# Preo
Parameterised Reo - a concrete language for a calculus of variable connectors

This is a simplified version, with less features, based on https://github.com/joseproenca/parameterised-connectors.

## Why a new project?
The emphasise is in the core language, which we call Preo, it's parser, and its static analysis.
We drop references to how to execute code and how to display it in a browser, and give less relevance
to the Scala embedded DSL.
